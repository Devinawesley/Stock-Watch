Stock-Watch
Watches an item and texts you when it's back in stock. 

Created out of a personal need, this is a simple script that uses the Selenium library to run a firefox browser to watch a specific page.
It continually reloads the page checking if the item is in stock. Once it finds the item in stock, it will send a text with a link to the page and stop.
